# Beego test app

[Beego](https://beego.me/) is an MVC framework written in Go.

App name `bhi` stands for `Beego Hello`.

## What's inside

The code is generated by `bee new bhi` command.

The index page prints "Hello $NAME", with $NAME coming from environment variable `NAME`.

The app also collects user feedback data and generates a PNG chart out of it.

## Run locally

bee run

## Deploy to production

Upload the binary:
```bash
bee pack && rsync -avH ./bhi.tar.gz  remote.host.name:
```

Setup host:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/beego.service
# see https://beego.me/docs/deploy/systemctl.md

## Enable optional tracing

The app collects traces in AWS X-Ray format
and sends them to the tracing daemon at UDP/localhost:2000.

Make sure [the `xray` daemon is running](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-sendingdata.html)
and [the `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html)
is assigned to your compute.

To see the traces, switch to [the x-ray web console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home?region=us-west-1#/service-map?timeRange=PT30M).
Then, choose the right region in the top right corner.
